# University-Network-Configuration-
It is a cisco packet tracer project  in which I have created a network via using VLSM subnetting configuration for the University's Computer network. 
It is my 2nd year undegraduate project in which I build a network using the assigned protocols such as RIP Protocol for routing, DHCP Protocol for assigning the IP addresses to the hosts or devices within the subnets .
